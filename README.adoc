=== deploy metrics-server
```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/download/v0.3.6/components.yaml
```

if you faced the problem about x509
then add the following args, then restart the pods you want to monitor
```sh
          - --kubelet-insecure-tls
          - --kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP
```

=== deploy k8s dashboard
```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.0.0/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml
```

remember, if you want to use metrics-server, you need deploy metrics-server before deploy dashboard. or the dashboard-metrics-scraper may failed to get metrics from metircs-server
